1. We covered Binary search in the class. Given an array of sorted numbers, you can search for an item using binary search. 
  Modify the algorithm so that you do tertiary search.  So in each iteration you divide into 3 parts.
  The program must be done using recursion. 

  Remember there are NO GLOBAL variables allowed.  NO static variables allowed.

   Run the program 4 times.

   1. Your array is a size of 15 numbers.  The number you are looking for is in the array.

   2. Your array is a size of 15 numbers.  The number you are looking for is NOT in the array.

   3. Your array is a size of 16 numbers.  The number you are looking for is in the array.

   4. Your array is a size of 16 numbers.  The number you are looking for is NOT in the array.
